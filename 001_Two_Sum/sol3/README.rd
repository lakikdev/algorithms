Input:
    Array - [6,5,2,7]
    Target - 9

Output:
    Array - [2, 3]


Idea:
   Create empty dictionary.

   Loop through given array and to check if key "target - num" exists in dictionary.
   If it does we return the indices. If key doesn't exist we store key and number index in dictionary
   and we repeat the action for other elements in given array.
